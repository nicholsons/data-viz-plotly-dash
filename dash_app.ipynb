    "# Workshop: How to make a COVID-19 web dashboard in under an hour using Plotly Dash\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic structure of a web app 5 mins\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very quick overview of how a web apps works. It is useful to understand the basic structure and technologies used in order to create your own web app.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Browser: Provides the user interface\n",
    "\n",
    "You all know what this is!\n",
    "\n",
    "Many browsers also provide tools to help you develop and debug web apps though we don't have time to cover these today.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HTML: Provides the structure of the web page\n",
    "\n",
    "Defined using tags e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "\n",
    "<!DOCTYPE html>\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "<head>\n",
    "    <!-- This section mostly tells the browser info about the page --!>\n",
    "</head>\n",
    "<body>\n",
    "    <!-- This section is what the user sees in the web page --!>\n",
    "    <h1>This is a heading</h1>\n",
    "    <p>This is a paragraph</p>\n",
    "</body>\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are plenty of references and tutorials on HTML. For today all you need to remember is that HTML tags provide the structure of the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can render HTML from a Jupyter notebook but it would require modifying the code. For a quick way to see the above code in action, go to [https://liveweave.com](https://liveweave.com) and copy and paste the code into the HTML box.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### CSS: Styles the HTML (colours, fonts, spacing etc)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of CSS styling for the ```<h1>``` tag:\n",
    "\n",
    "```css\n",
    "h1 {\n",
    "    color: blueviolet;\n",
    "    font-family: \"American Typewriter\";\n",
    "    font-weight: bold;\n",
    "    padding: 5em;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different ways to add the styles to your code. We wil stick to adding styles in a `.css` file. You tell\n",
    "the `.html` file where the css file is in the head section of the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it even easier we are going to use someone else's CSS, in this case a widely ised library called [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/). They even give you the HTML code to copy and paste.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<head>\n",
    "    <link href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.1/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" integrity=\"sha384-+0n0xVW2eSR5OomGNYDnhzAbDsOXxcvSN1TPprVMTNDbiYZCxYbOOl7+AMvyTG2x\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\">\n",
    "</head>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When a browser receives a web page to display, it generates a tree structure to represent the page called the Domain Object Model, DOM. The DOM has methods that allow programmatic access to elements in this tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "![The HTML DOM Tree of Objects](dom_tree.gif)\n",
    "[Source w3schools.com]: https://www.w3schools.com/js/pic_htmltree.gif\n",
    "\n",
    "CSS is applied to one or more HTML elements using 'selectors'. A selector is a mechanism to locate a particular HTML element on a web page and apply styling to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For today, you just need to know that the look and feel of the page is mostly determined by styles that are defined\n",
    "using CSS. You programmatically select one or more elements to apply the defined styles to.\n",
    "\n",
    "### JavaScript: Adds interactivity to a web page\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript is a programming language. It (mostly) runs in the browser and is used to support interactivity. We are not going to use any JavaScript directly in this workshop. Plotly Dash abstracts this away for us by providing python methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Web server\n",
    "\n",
    "Most websites use some kind of server technology to dynamically generate data to be displayed. There are numerous\n",
    "languages and technologies you can use for this, we are going to use the Python version of Plotly Dash. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dash itself makes use of another framework called Flask which is used to create web apps. We might have\n",
    "a look at this in another session and see how you can include visualisations and machine learning models in a web app.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HTTP: A protocol that supports communication between the web broswer and web server\n",
    "\n",
    "HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a protocol (a set of rules) for transferring images, text and audio between a web browser and a web server.\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't need to code anything that directly expresses HTTP for this workshop.\n",

    "## How to use python Plotly Dash to create a simple web data dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Plotly Dash?\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotly Dash is a high level library that provides a way for you to create a web app dashboard using Python (as well as R and Julia). It is designed for creating \"web analytics applications\" [Plotly dash](https://dash.plotly.com/introduction).\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the covers Dash builds on Plotly.js, React.js and Flask.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can build dash apps with multiple pages, however to do that you will need to understand a little more about HTTP and routing. For today, we are going to build a single page app.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create the basic web page\n",
    "\n",
    "Binder: Use the cell below where the code is already available.\n",
    "\n",
    "IDE: Create a new python file called `app.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the following code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Import the dash libraries\n",
    "import dash\n",
    "import dash_html_components as html\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creates the Dash web app\n",
    "app = dash.Dash(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Defines the layout of the page. Uses python methods to generate HTML.\n",
    "app.layout = html.Div(children=[\n",
    "    html.H1(children='Hello Dash'),\n",
    "])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Runs the web app. By default you should be able to access it at http://127.0.0.1:8050/ in a web browser\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run_server(debug=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Run this app with `python app.py` and go to http://127.0.0.1:8050/ in your web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Add styling\n",
    "Let's use bootstrap to provide the CSS stylesheet using the dash-bootstrap-components library.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to add the import:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import dash_bootstrap_components as dbc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then apply the stylesheet to the Dash app:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "app = dash.Dash(external_stylesheets=[dbc.themes.BOOTSTRAP])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The code now looks like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import dash\n",
    "import dash_html_components as html\n",
    "import dash_bootstrap_components as dbc\n",
    "\n",
    "app = dash.Dash(external_stylesheets=[dbc.themes.BOOTSTRAP])\n",
    "\n",
    "app.layout = html.Div(children=[\n",
    "    html.H1(children='Hello Dash'),\n",
    "])\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run_server(debug=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiment with different [themes](https://dash-bootstrap-components.opensource.faculty.ai/docs/themes/) and choose one \n",
    "you like. You may need to refresh the browser to see the changes but you shouldn't need to stop and restart the Dash app.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Stretch:\n",
    "Bootstrap provides a way to make your design 'responsive', that is it tries to alter the style appropriately for \n",
    "browsers on different size devices (think difference between small portrait mobile phone and larger landscape laptop).\n",
    "To support the responsive design you need to move HTML elements into a container.\n",
    "Alter your layout to this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "app.layout = dbc.Container(children=\n",
    "    [\n",
    "        html.H1(\"Hello Dash\"),\n",
    "        html.P(\"This is my first Dash app\")\n",
    "    ],\n",
    "    fluid=True,\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Add the chart\n",
    "Firstly we need to generate the chart. The following code recreates the chart from Albert's {TODO: add correct reference}\n",
    "Add this code to app.py (or you could create a separate code file if you prefer).\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def make_chart():\n",
    "data = pd.read_csv(\"https://cdn.opensource.faculty.ai/world-phones/data.csv\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To add a chart we need to import dash_core_components:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import dash_core_components as dcc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We then need to add the chart control to the layout:\n",
