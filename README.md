### Structure

We will do a live, interactive coding workshop to learn how to re-create plots based and publish them in a web
dashboard.

The session will cover:

- Basic structure of a web app
- How to use python Plotly Dash to create a simple web data dashboard
- How to add chart interactivity using callbacks

Instructions are provided in `instructions.md` (markdown file) and `instructions.ipynb` jupyter notebook.

### Preparation

I will use [binder](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) to avoid requiring you to install an IDE.

Please click the following to use a web version of JupyterLab with the dependencies installed [Binder]()

If you have an IDE e.g. PyCharm (professional version with [free academic license](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students)) or Visual Studio Code, then it
would be useful to set up the basic project before the session. Guidelines for this are in `instructions.md`.
