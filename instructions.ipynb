The arguments are positional: first the Input items and then any State items are given in the same order as in the decorator.\n",

    "### What is a Dash callback?\n",
    "\n",
    "A callback is a Python decorator (function) that is automatically called by Dash whenever a particular component's (\n",
    "referred to as the Input) property changes and makes a change to another component (the Output) as a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic structure of a callback is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@app.callback(Output(component_id='my-output', component_property='a_property'),\n",
    "              [Input(component_id='my-input', component_property='another_property')]\n",
    "              )\n",
    "def update_output_div(input_value):\n",
    "    return 'Output: {}'.format(input_value)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can use any name for the function that is wrapped by the @app.callback decorator. The convention is that the name describes the callback output(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can use any name for the function arguments, but you must use the same names inside the callback function as you do in its definition, just like in a regular Python function. The arguments are positional: first the Input items and then any State items are given in the same order as in the decorator.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You must use the same id you gave a Dash component in the app.layout when referring to it as either an Input or Output of the @app.callback decorator.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The @app.callback decorator needs to be directly above the callback function declaration. If there is a blank line between the decorator and the function definition, the callback registration will not be successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Add the new chart to the layout\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the following to the global variables in `app.py`.\n",
